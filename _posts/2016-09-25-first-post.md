title: Maximizing Student Voter Registration outside the NYC Subway
---

This week I imagined myself as a consultant to the NY Democratic Party.  With the election coming up in a mere 6 weeks (!), it’s a busy time in politics.  One of the perennial challenges for political parties and their candidates is motivating and turning out their own likely voters, those who can be expected to vote for them rather than the competition.  In every election cycle, this involves identifying and registering new voters who fit the bill.  For the Democrats, young people who haven’t voted before are a major target demographic.  If they vote, they are disproportionately likely to vote for Democrats.  Yet they are much less likely than older Americans to be registered.

To help the NY Democrats find and register young voters in New York City, my team and I focused on college and university students.  Because of the 501(c)(3) status of not-for-profit educational institutions, on-campus voter registration efforts must generally be non-partisan.  Therefore, we focused on helping the party to locate students as they come and go from campus.  Because many students commute to campus via the subway, we recommended that the party deploy voter registration teams outside stations near major campuses throughout the city.  We began by identifying the top 15 schools by enrollment, as shown on the map below.

We focused on the three nearest subway stations for each school.  This led to a list of about 40 target stations (there was some overlap in stations across schools and one school that was not in walking distance of the subway).  With these target stations in mind, we used turnstile data from the MTA for the last four weeks (08/20 – 09/16) to identify when and where the party should send its teams.  Our data focused on entries into the subway system, which should capture the volume of people leaving the target stations.  Working from two assumptions – that students would be leaving campus in the afternoon and early evening hours, and that the party had ten registration teams to deploy at any given time – our final product was a registration team deployment schedule.  The schedule covers ten periods each week: an afternoon and an evening shift for Monday – Friday.  The ten stations listed for each time period represent those with the highest average turnstile entry traffic across our four-week period.  The final schedule of the stations for the evening shifts (4pm – 8 pm) is shown below.
